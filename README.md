Electronic Tongue Applications To Distinguish Black Tea Bohea, Pf1 &amp; Pf2 Using Deep Neural Network.
Research on electronic tongues application has been carried out to distinguish black tea based on Indonesian National Standard (SNI). Research was conducted by analyzing three types of black tea i.e. BOHEA, PF1, and PF2 using electronic tongue devices. Electronic tongue device is composed of 16 array of taste sensors made by combining lipid membrane and reference electrode. Potential data for each sensor were verified using Deep Neural Network (DNN). Data is used to train model and internal validation using cross validation (80% data) and external validation (20% data). From testing black tea samples using DNN method obtained an accuracy value of 97.95%. Thus, an electronic tongue can be used to distinguish between types of black tea.
